                <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                <p>This project is a case study of the WHOOP app, focusing on enhancing its Community feature and improving the app's user experience design. The goal was to analyze the app's features, usability, and overall design to develop ways in which to integrate the Community feature more seamlessly.</p>

                <h2>Project Details</h2>
                <p>The WHOOP app is designed to help users track their fitness and health metrics. It provides insights into sleep, recovery, and strain, allowing users to optimize their performance.</p>
                <p>My team was given the task of understanding users' experience with the current Community tab and designing features that would enhance WHOOP's Community aspect.</p>

                <h2>Research</h2>
                <p>The first step to improving any product and a user's experience is to analyze what exists already. In the case of WHOOP, this meant understanding what features already existed and how users interacted with those.</p>
                <p>Through analytics provided from the fitness application, we found that one of the main challenges WHOOP's Community tab faced was a low engagement rate, especially when it came to users who opened the tab but seldom took any action in it.</p>

                    Most users donâ€™t take any action after opening the Community tab.
                </blockquote>

                <p>Currently, the WHOOP app features few community features. The main aspects of the Community tab include the ability to refer a friend and the options to join and view teams with whom the user's statistics and health metrics are shared and compared with the other members' metrics.</p>

                <h3>Competitor Analysis</h3>
                <p>To better understand communities and what users enjoy most about them, I decided to research other platforms' community features. Among these were Strava (a direct competitor to WHOOP), FitBit (direct competitor) Spotify (indirect competitor), and Discord (indirect competitor).</p>

                <h2>User Research</h2>
                <p>To better understand the users of WHOOP, I conducted user interviews and analyzed survey responses from participants who were current users of the app. The goal was to understand their experience with the Community tab and what features they would like to see. I also aimed to know more about what existing features they liked from other digital communities as well as what features they felt were lacking in any of those communities.</p>

                <h2>Next Steps</h2>
                <p>Taking users' inputs into account and analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of other communities, along with WHOOP's, I proposed 3 features that would help WHOOP's users feel more connected and engaged with friends and other users.</p>
                <p><strong>Feature #1: WHOOP Experts</strong></p>
                <p>Users expressed the desire to connect with others for advice and tips. While an AI Chatbot (WHOOP Coach) exists within the app to support users' questions, <strong>WHOOP Experts</strong> are real-life professionals who create content that feels authentic and relatable.</p>
                <div class="whoop-images">
                    <img src="images/whoop/whoop_experts.png" alt="whoop experts slide">
                </div>
                <p><strong>Feature #2: GeoGroups</strong></p>
                <p>Talking in an app chatroom and viewing each other's health metrics is an amazing start, but offering the ability to find fitness communities based on physical location would allow WHOOP to take its communities to the next level.</p>
                 <div class="whoop-images">
                    <img src="images/whoop/whoop_geogroups.png" alt="whoop geogroups slide">
                </div>
                <p><strong>Feature #3: Contact Sync</strong></p>
                <p>Not the best at meeting new people? No problem! WHOOP will now have a <strong>Contact Sync</strong> feature, allowing users to find friends and family members who are already WHOOP users. Connecting with others and sharing metrics are only a few taps away.</p>
                <div class="whoop-images">
                    <img src="images/whoop/whoop_contactsync.png" alt="whoop contact sync slide">
                </div>
                <p>Using a RICE scoring model, I was able to prioritize these features based on their reach, impact, confidence, and effort. The results showed that the Contact Sync feature would have the highest impact on user engagement and satisfaction, followed by GeoGroups and WHOOP Experts. This user flow allows us to visualize the process that a user would take to connect with friends and family members through the Contact Sync feature.</p>
