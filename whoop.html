                <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                <p>This project is a case study of the WHOOP app, focusing on enhancing its Community feature and improving the app's user experience design. The goal was to analyze the app's features, usability, and overall design to develop ways in which to integrate the Community feature more seamlessly.</p>

                <h2>Project Details</h2>
                <p>The WHOOP app is designed to help users track their fitness and health metrics. It provides insights into sleep, recovery, and strain, allowing users to optimize their performance.</p>
                <p>My team was given the task of understanding users' experience with the current Community tab and designing features that would enhance WHOOP's Community aspect.</p>

                    <li><strong>Duration:</strong> 4 months</li>

                <h2>Research</h2>
                <p>The first step to improving any product and a user's experience is to analyze what exists already. In the case of WHOOP, this meant understanding what features already existed and how users interacted with those.</p>
                <p>Through analytics provided from the fitness application, we found that one of the main challenges WHOOP's Community tab faced was a low engagement rate, especially when it came to users who opened the tab but seldom took any action in it.</p>

                    Most users donâ€™t take any action after opening the Community tab.
                </blockquote>

                <p>Currently, the WHOOP app features few community features. The main aspects of the Community tab include the ability to refer a friend and the options to join and view teams with whom the user's statistics and health metrics are shared and compared with the other members' metrics.</p>

                <h3>Competitor Analysis</h3>
                <p>To better understand communities and what users enjoy most about them, I decided to research other platforms' community features. Among these were Strava (a direct competitor to WHOOP), FitBit (direct competitor) Spotify (indirect competitor), and Discord (indirect competitor).</p>

                    <strong>Findings:</strong> Users enjoy communities where they can interact with other members and share statistics regarding their app usage and habits with their friends and family.
